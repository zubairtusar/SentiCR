excellent calculator this is an excellent floating calculator  in spite of some (minor) shortcomings. it has all the features that one would want in a small calculator that can be used while one is using other apps. the lack of memory functions is easily overcome with the use of parentheses  and with these  the copy function is more than adequate for most purposes. one useful feature which it does not have at the moment  is the ability to paste/insert data copied from  say  a text file. this would make it possible to use earier results stored in a text file. nevertheless  this is an excellent app  and the developer should be congratulated for a job well done  and for generously making it available a no cost.
