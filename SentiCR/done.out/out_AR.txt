i love it   but i would love to make this my default sms app i'm an old textra and chomp user.  only gripe is need a lot of improvement like bubble chats even u don't make it bubble it's ok just have a bit of space bet messages cause it is confusing and cluttered to look at.  then also led notification that's one thing that keeps me from using. this as a. daily driver. .  we need better notifications..  this app is worth 5.stars i'd even buy it if it had a price. just to have it full featured. and also text counts on icon

simply the best i very rarely write reviews. even more rare is when i like an app enough to buy it. this app deserves both. i have  seriously  tried most music players for the android and this one has everything i need. audio engine is tops  start and stop via headphone jack  great album art download. lots of other programs have these things but either lack in these or other features. i especially like the simple issue of bass and treble control. price a little high  that was the only thing holding me back from buying it sooner. was thinking of giving it 4 stars because of price but; what the heck- i gave it five.

anoying bug i use both the powertoggles notification bar widget and home screen widget.  really good concept as a whole. but... the home screen widget always freezes a couple hours after i configured it.  the widgetbis used to launch my favorite apps  not for toggling anything if you want to resolve it  i can try to give you more info. ofc rating goes up if this is resolved!! :-) ** bug doesn't occur anymore! :d

widget locks up my galaxy s3 this a very beautiful looking app and i like it a lot but it regularly locks up the homescreen widget  the clock freezes and the weather status locks up with the status "locating". my phone is a samsung galaxy s3 running on 4.1.1 based in the uk. hope this info helps solve the issue as this app is definitely worth a full 5 stars if it were not for it locking up. please fix this and i'll even purchase the add free pro version ;-)

great app but not perfect if i were reviewing comixology the service  i'd give it five stars. however  this is for the android app  and for that  i can only give it three.  i'd used the ipad app  with it's great "hd" support  which is lacking on some android tablets.  that's not a major issue  but the biggest drawback to the app is the lack of sd support.  a majority of tablets have the option for sd cards  expanding their storage space  and many apps can take advantage of it.  it's a shame comixology's app hasn't been able to do this yet.  i don't know if it's concerns over security  if someone could take the books on the card and copy them elsewhere  but seriously  it's easy enough to copy files from system memory if you look it up.  give users the option to save to sd cards and this review will jump to five stars.

really like this app allows me to both catalog my collection and display and sort my collection to make it easier for friends to decide what they want to watch.  i recommend you get the pro version. it's diverse features and ability to access your database from any of your appliances or computers is a blessing. the ability to modify the meta data stored for your movies would be good as sometimes the data is miss classified or incorrectly genred

good but lacking all in all the app works  but its pretty lack-luster. it does a few things well and a few ok  like the feed  friends list and adding  messaging  and connecting to your ps4 for second display features. but it stops there. the store takes you a external browser  the second screen features are limited and the keyboard is a bit buggy and only works 70% of the time  its slow and the positioning of things is not efficient. the ui isn't all that intuitive with its lack of gestures and easily accessible features.

good app it's customizable which i like. sometimes it's a bit difficult getting items to line up properly and the areas for each part of the display don't change size dynamically so the font sizes will get bigger or smaller to fit in the space alloted for them which i don't like. overall it's a good app though.

excellent calculator this is an excellent floating calculator  in spite of some (minor) shortcomings. it has all the features that one would want in a small calculator that can be used while one is using other apps. the lack of memory functions is easily overcome with the use of parentheses  and with these  the copy function is more than adequate for most purposes. one useful feature which it does not have at the moment  is the ability to paste/insert data copied from  say  a text file. this would make it possible to use earier results stored in a text file. nevertheless  this is an excellent app  and the developer should be congratulated for a job well done  and for generously making it available a no cost.

there is room for improvement... the good thing  it lets you know when your moga (pro) has been connected to your android device and it displays current games that support the controller. the bad thing: a.its interface. it's boring  even my 14yr old cousin can make it look like tegra zone-based stylish themed or better. b.the bluetooth connection. when i'm using the game  the controller loses the connection with it for too long so i have to press the moga button and try to reconnect;or it happens for a few seconds and while i'm using the controller  my notification keeps showing the controller has been connected to my tablet. c.the moga pivot connects the controller to the android device  but why on earth does it not display the controller battery life? how much longer can my controller's built-in battery last? it should let me know. d.just let me know whenever a new game has support for the controller. i'm talking about pivot running in the background  self-updating its catalog and pushing a notification warning me a new game has entered the 'supported games' list. it'd be great. e.sometimes the controller takes too long to connect. what's with the hold up? please fix these issues. they are worth a new update.
